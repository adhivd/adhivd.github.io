I regularly come across really great pieces of writing on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news). Sometimes, these writings happen to come from blogs of people who have really great insights on a particular topic or field, so I started to bookmark them.

Here are several people + blogs I follow, many written by software engineers and investors. I'll update this as time goes on.
