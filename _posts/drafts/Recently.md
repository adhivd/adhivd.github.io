This pandemic has given me a lot of time to think and process my current state of life. I've found myself picking up and dropping hobbies left and right. School felt like a burden, even just to pass. I wanted to put down some of my thoughts to establish a clear agenda.

### Readings  

I have a huge problem with seeing through side projects. Refuse to Choose

### Music

My high school friends have been into music for as long as I can remember. I specifically remember us organizing rap battles at our old elementary school, creating impromptu guitar songs on Bart rides to SF.

Most recently, a couple of them got together to make an album (Summer Rain on SoundCloud). This was super impressive to me; anyone can make music with enough effort and resourcefulness.

Hence, I recently installed Logic Pro X and have been practicing music production. I've found it to be therapeutic, playing random melodies on the piano, experimenting with sounds, setting up catchy drum patterns.

I've officially set up a SoundCloud. I probably won't publicly announce most of my music. but I'm hoping to put together at least 5 "beats" that I'm proud of and are well produced by the end of 2020.
